            <h2>Football: The Beautiful Game</h2>
            <p>Football, or soccer in some countries, is the most popular sport in the world, played by millions in 
            every corner of the globe. The game is played with a spherical ball, typically with two teams of 11 
            players each. The objective of the game is to score more goals than the opponent, which is achieved by 
            getting the ball into the opposing team's net. The simplicity of football, combined with its exciting 
            fast-paced nature, makes it beloved by fans worldwide.</p>
            <p>Whether it's the intense drama of the FIFA World Cup or the local street football games, football 
            brings people together, transcending language, culture, and geographic boundaries. From legendary players 
            like Pele and Maradona to modern icons like Messi and Ronaldo, football has produced countless moments of 
            magic that will be remembered for generations.</p>
